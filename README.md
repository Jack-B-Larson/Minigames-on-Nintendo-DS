# Minigames on Nintendo DS

[YouTube Demo](https://youtu.be/FHL20EB8gOA)

While the demo is shown played through an emulator, this game has been successfully tested on real hardware using a flash cart.

Features:
Game selection page.
A universal pause system that allows you to return to the selection menu.
A Snake game with settings for speed, which screen to display on, and controls.
Four game-modes for Snake inspired by the Google Snake game: Classic, Multiple Fruit, Bricks, No Walls, and Portal Fruits.
A Battleship game with three modes: Classic, Russian, and Fleet.
It uses a pass-and-play system in which the screens are blacked out and the player is prompted to pass the console to the other player, who then has the ability to reveal the screen once more.
Ships can be placed anywhere on the grid, given they do not intersect the walls or each other.
When a ship has been hit along all of its grid spaces, it will be correctly marked as sunk, and the game will end when one player has sunk all of their opponents ships.
The alternative modes provide a different set of ships to play with.
